Gamma - Generic Synthesis C++ Library

========================================
1. About
========================================

Gamma is a cross-platform, C++ library for doing generic synthesis and filtering of numerical data. It contains numerous mathematical functions, common algebraic types, such as vectors, complex numbers, and quaternions, an assortment of sequence generators and many objects for signal processing. It is oriented towards real-time sound and graphics rendering, but is equally useful for non-real-time tasks.


========================================
2. Compilation Instructions
========================================

The source code can either be built into a library or directly compiled from source into an application. In the following, the base directory is where this README file is located.


----------------------------------------
2.1 Building a Library
----------------------------------------
........................................
Make (Linux, OS X)
........................................
In most cases, simply running

	make

will build the library with automatically detected platform settings. See Makefile.config for other build options.

There are several other rules within Makefile. These are:

	make			- builds static library
	make install		- installs library into DESTDIR
	make clean		- removes binaries from build folder
	make examples/y/x.cpp	- builds and runs example source file y/x.cpp
	make tests/x.cpp	- builds and runs test source file x.cpp

The rules that build examples and tests will automatically run the executable by default. To turn this off, pass AUTORUN=0 to make. The examples and tests rules follow standard Unix conventions so that, for instance, all the tests can be built and run by typing the command 'make tests/test*.cpp'.
Binaries are located in ./build/release or ./build/debug depending on the build configuration. On OS X, the Gamma library will be linked to the pre-compiled dependent libraries in external/lib_osx. On Linux, use apt-get to install the necessary dependent libraries (see 2.3 below).

........................................
Xcode (OS X)
........................................
1) Open project/xcode/gamma.xcodeproj
2) Build libgamma{.a, .dylib}. The library will be in project build folder.


----------------------------------------
2.2 Compiling Direct From Source
----------------------------------------
Gamma can easily be compiled directly from source into an existing project.

Make sure to pass in the following flags to the compiler:

	-D__STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS
	-finline-functions (or -O3)
	-fpeel-loops


----------------------------------------
2.3 Dependencies
----------------------------------------
Gamma depends conditionally on the libraries

	PortAudio v19
	libsndfile

for performing audio and sound file i/o.

They are only required if using certain Gamma objects:

	PortAudio is required ONLY if you are using AudioIO (AudioIO.h).
	libsndfile is required ONLY for SoundFile i/o and playback (SoundFile.h, Player.h).
